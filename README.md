# AspireNex AI Internship Assesment

This repository contains two AI projects.

## Project 1: Rule-based Chatbot

### Overview
This project is a rule-based chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot can perform various tasks such as arithmetic calculations, date and time queries, random number generation, mathematical and statistical calculations, opening URLs, and file operations.

### Deployed Python Rule Based Chatbot Web Application
https://aspirenexpythonchatbot.streamlit.app/

### Features
- Arithmetic calculations
- Date and time queries
- Random number generation
- Mathematical and statistical calculations
- Opening URLs
- File and directory operations
- System information queries
- Help and basic conversational responses

### Dependencies
- re
- datetime
- random
- math
- statistics
- calendar
- webbrowser
- os
- sys
- operator
- streamlit

### Example
Here are some sample queries you can try with the chatbot:
- "Hello! How are you?"
- "Can you tell me today's date?"
- "What's the current time?"
- "Generate a random number for me."
- "What is the square root of 25?"
- "Calculate the factorial of 5."
- "What is the sine of 30 degrees?"
- "What is the natural logarithm of 10?"
- "Find the exponential of 2."
- "What is 2 raised to the power of 3?"
- "Round 3.14159 to the nearest whole number."
- "What is the absolute value of -15?"
- "Is 5 greater than 3?"
- "What is the mean of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?"
- "Find the median of 4, 2, 7, 3, 8."
- "What is the mode of 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3?"
- "Show me the calendar for 2024."
- "Open website https://www.google.com."
- "Create a file named 'example.txt'."
- "Give me some help on what you can do."

## Project 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

### Overview
This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent implemented using the minimax algorithm. The game is built with Python and uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI).

### Features
- Interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical interface
- Play against an AI opponent using the minimax algorithm
- Reset the game board to start a new game

### Dependencies
- tkinter
- functools

### Example
After running the script, a window will appear where you can play Tic-Tac-Toe against the AI. The game board will update with each move, and a message box will display the result when the game ends.
